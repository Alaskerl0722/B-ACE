# B-ACE: Beyond Visual Range Air Combat Environment

B-ACE is an open-source, lightweight simulation environment designed to facilitate the experimentation and evaluation of autonomous agents in Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air combat scenarios. Built on the Godot game engine, B-ACE leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to explore advanced techniques in autonomous air combat agent development. The environment provides a flexible and accessible platform for the research community, enabling the rapid prototyping and evaluation of AI-based tactics and strategies in complex air combat settings.

## Features
- **Open-source and easily extensible:** Researchers can easily modify and extend the environment to suit their specific needs.
- **Integration with MARL frameworks:** Compatible with popular reinforcement learning libraries such as Gymnasium and PettingZoo.
- **Simplified yet representative BVR combat dynamics:** Focuses on key aspects of air combat, offering a balance between realism and accessibility.
- **Supports single and multi-agent learning scenarios:** Ideal for exploring both individual and cooperative agent behaviors.

## Documentation
Detailed use cases and setup instructions will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates!
